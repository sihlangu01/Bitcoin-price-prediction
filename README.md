## Bitcoin Price Prediction and reccomendation system

**Introduction**

Bitcoin, a leading cryptocurrency, exhibits high price volatility, making accurate price prediction crucial for investors and traders. This project leverages machine learning to forecast Bitcoin prices and provide actionable trading recommendations.

**üìùProject Overview**

This project involves several key steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering historical Bitcoin price data from reliable sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the data for model training, which includes handling missing values, formatting dates, and potentially engineering new features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the data to identify trends, patterns, and outliers, which helps in understanding the data's characteristics and informing model selection.
4. **Model Selection:** Choosing an appropriate machine learning model. In this case, we've selected a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network due to its ability to handle time series data and capture long-term dependencies.
5. **Model Training:** Training the LSTM model on the historical data to learn the patterns and relationships in Bitcoin's price movements.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R¬≤) to assess its accuracy and generalization ability.
7. **Trading Strategy Development:** Developing a trading strategy based on the model's predictions, which includes setting thresholds for buy, sell, and hold signals.
8. **Dashboard Creation:** Building an interactive dashboard to visualize the model's predictions, trading recommendations, and relevant performance metrics.

**Objectives**

* Develop an accurate machine learning model to predict future Bitcoin prices.
* Generate clear trading recommendations (buy, sell, or hold) based on the predictions.
* Create a user-friendly interactive dashboard to visualize the predictions and aid in decision-making.

**Methodology**

* **LSTM Model:** We utilize a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of deep learning model well-suited for sequential data like Bitcoin prices, as it can capture long-term dependencies and patterns.
* **Data:** Historical Bitcoin price data is used to train and evaluate the model.
* **Evaluation:** Model performance is assessed using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R¬≤) to measure accuracy and goodness-of-fit.

**Dashboard**

An interactive dashboard will be developed to visualize the model's predictions and trading recommendations, providing a user-friendly interface for investors and traders.
