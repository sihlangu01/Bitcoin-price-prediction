# Bitcoin-price-prediction

### **üìå Project Overview**

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Bitcoin price data to uncover trends, volatility, trading volume variations, and seasonality. The analysis includes visualizing price trends, identifying outliers, detecting anomalies, and understanding the correlation between trading volume and price fluctuations. Additionally, this project emphasizes statistical techniques such as moving averages, hypothesis testing, and time series decomposition to highlight deeper insights.

### **üìÇ Dataset**

The dataset contains historical Bitcoin price information with the following key columns:

**Timestamp** ‚Äì Date and time of recorded price.

**Open** ‚Äì Opening price of Bitcoin for the given period.

**High** ‚Äì Highest price within the period.

**Low** ‚Äì Lowest price within the period.

**Close** ‚Äì Closing price.

**Volume** ‚Äì Total trading volume.

**Hour** ‚Äì Extracted hour from the timestamp to analyze intraday trends.

**Month** ‚Äì Extracted month to observe seasonal patterns.

**Year** ‚Äì Extracted year to identify long-term trends.
