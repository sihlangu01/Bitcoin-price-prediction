## Bitcoin Price Prediction and reccomendation system

**Introduction**

Bitcoin, a leading cryptocurrency, exhibits high price volatility, making accurate price prediction crucial for investors and traders. This project leverages machine learning to forecast Bitcoin prices and provide actionable trading recommendations.

**üìùProject Overview**

This project is structured across three Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a distinct phase of development:

**1. Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
This notebook focuses on the initial data processing. It covers the manipulation and cleaning of raw Bitcoin price data.
It also provides informative insights into Bitcoin's price performance over the years, including volatility analysis and other relevant observations.

**2. LSTM Model Development & Evaluation:**
This notebook details the steps involved in training the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.
It demonstrates how the model performs its predictions, including evaluations and performance metrics.
It concludes with insights and conclusions derived from the model's performance.

**3. Interactive Streamlit Dashboard:**
This notebook outlines the steps taken to build an interactive Streamlit dashboard.
The dashboard allows for the visualization of model predictions, trading recommendations, and other relevant data..

**Objectives**

* Develop an accurate machine learning model to predict future Bitcoin prices.
* Generate clear trading recommendations (buy, sell, or hold) based on the predictions.
* Create a user-friendly interactive dashboard to visualize the predictions and aid in decision-making.

**Methodology**

* **LSTM Model:** We utilize a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of deep learning model well-suited for sequential data like Bitcoin prices, as it can capture long-term dependencies and patterns.
* **Data:** Historical Bitcoin price data is used to train and evaluate the model.
* **Evaluation:** Model performance is assessed using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R¬≤) to measure accuracy and goodness-of-fit.

**Dashboard**

An interactive dashboard will be developed to visualize the model's predictions and trading recommendations, providing a user-friendly interface for investors and traders.
